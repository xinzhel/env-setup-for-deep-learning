As a researcher working with scientific computing and ML, using the linux command line interface or [shell](https://scicomp.aalto.fi/scicomp/shell/) benefits my workflow a lot.

In this repository, I record my environment setup, mostly for machine learning.
* [Linux environment setup on Windows](https://gist.github.com/xinzhel/e6e60d5aece30703fb10f0b2e555e639)
* [Python environment setup on Linux](https://github.com/xinzhel/machine_learning_on_linux/blob/master/pyenv.sh)
* [Azure Linux Virtual Machine setup](https://github.com/xinzhel/machine_learning_on_linux/blob/master/AzureSpotDSVM.sh): The link provides the script to perform automated creation and setup of [Data Science Virtual Machine](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/data-science-virtual-machine/overview).
